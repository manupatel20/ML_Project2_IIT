### Components

1. **Decision Tree Regressor**
   - Implemented in `src/decision_tree.py`
   - Serves as the base learner for the gradient boosting classifier
   - Features:
     - Recursive binary splitting based on mean squared error
     - Configurable maximum depth, minimum samples for split/leaf
     - Prediction functionality for regression tasks

2. **Gradient Boosting Classifier**
   - Implemented in `src/gradient_boosting.py`

     - Binary classification using log loss function
     - Forward stagewise additive modeling approach
     - Fitting trees to negative gradients (pseudoresiduals)
     - Configurable number of estimators, learning rate, and tree parameters
     - Prediction with probability estimates
     - Feature importance calculation

3. **Test Data Generation**
   - Implemented in `src/data_generation.py`
   - Generates various synthetic datasets:
     - Linear separable data
     - Nonlinear data
     - Moons dataset
     - Circles dataset
     - XOR dataset

4. **Testing Framework**
   - Implemented in `tests/test_gradient_boosting.py`
   - Tests the classifier on multiple datasets
   - Evaluates performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC AUC)
   - Tests different hyperparameter configurations
   - Visualizes decision boundaries

## Algorithm Description

The gradient boosting algorithm implemented in this project follows these steps:

1. **Initialization**: Start with an initial prediction (log-odds of the base rate for binary classification)
2. **Iterative Process**: For m = 1 to M (number of estimators):
   - Calculate negative gradients (pseudoresiduals) of the loss function with respect to current predictions
   - Fit a regression tree to these pseudoresiduals
   - For each leaf region in the tree, compute the optimal update value
   - Update the model by adding the new tree's predictions scaled by the learning rate
3. **Prediction**: Convert final log-odds to probabilities using the sigmoid function and classify based on a threshold

## Test Results

The implementation was tested on various synthetic datasets with the following results:

| Dataset   | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | ROC AUC |
|-----------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Linear    | 0.9700   | 0.9794    | 0.9596 | 0.9694   | 0.9977  |
| Nonlinear | 0.9350   | 0.9674    | 0.8990 | 0.9319   | 0.9777  |
| Moons     | 0.9850   | 0.9899    | 0.9800 | 0.9849   | 0.9993  |
| Circles   | 0.7450   | 0.7168    | 0.8100 | 0.7606   | 0.7846  |
| XOR       | 0.9050   | 0.8614    | 0.9457 | 0.9016   | 0.9817  |

### Hyperparameter Testing

Different hyperparameter configurations were tested on the Nonlinear dataset:

| n_estimators | Accuracy | ROC AUC |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| 10           | 0.9350   | 0.9716  |
| 50           | 0.9150   | 0.9800  |
| 100          | 0.9400   | 0.9829  |

The results show that increasing the number of estimators generally improves performance, with diminishing returns after a certain point. The learning rate and maximum tree depth also significantly impact model performance, with deeper trees potentially leading to overfitting on the training data.

## Conclusions

The gradient boosting tree classification algorithm implementation successfully demonstrates the principles described in Elements of Statistical Learning. The algorithm shows strong performance across various datasets, particularly excelling on datasets with clear decision boundaries (Linear, Moons, XOR). The implementation struggles more with the Circles dataset, which has a more complex circular decision boundary that is challenging for axis-parallel splits used in decision trees.

The hyperparameter testing confirms the importance of tuning the number of estimators, learning rate, and tree depth to achieve optimal performance for a given dataset. The implementation provides a solid foundation for understanding gradient boosting from first principles and can be extended to handle multi-class classification or regression tasks.

## Future Improvements

Potential improvements to the implementation include:
1. Support for multi-class classification
2. Implementation of different loss functions
3. Subsampling for stochastic gradient boosting
4. Early stopping based on validation performance
5. More sophisticated regularization techniques
6. Parallel tree building for improved performance
