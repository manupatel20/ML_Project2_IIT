# Gradient Boosting Tree Classification Algorithm

## Overview
Gradient Boosting is a powerful machine learning technique that builds an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees, in a sequential manner. Each new model is trained to correct the errors made by the previous models, gradually improving the overall prediction accuracy.

## Mathematical Foundation

### Additive Model
Gradient boosting fits an additive model:

```
f(x) = ∑(m=1 to M) βm b(x; γm)
```

where:
- `b(x; γm)` are the base functions (decision trees)
- `βm` are the weights
- `γm` are the parameters of the base functions

### Loss Function
The algorithm aims to minimize a loss function `L(y, f(x))` which measures the difference between the predicted value `f(x)` and the true value `y`.

### Forward Stagewise Additive Modeling (FSAM)
FSAM is a technique that approximates the fitting of an additive model by sequentially fitting its base functions:

1. Initialize with a constant model: `f0(x) = arg min_γ ∑(i=1 to N) L(yi, γ)`
2. For m = 1 to M:
   - Compute the parameters for the next base function: `(βm, γm) = arg min_{β,γ} ∑(i=1 to N) L(yi, fm-1(xi) + β b(xi; γ))`
   - Update the model: `fm(x) = fm-1(x) + βm b(x; γm)`
3. Return the final model: `fM(x)`

## Gradient Boosting Algorithm

Gradient boosting generalizes FSAM by using gradient descent in function space. Instead of directly minimizing the loss function (which can be difficult for some loss functions), it fits each new base function to the negative gradient of the loss function with respect to the current model's predictions.

### Gradient Tree Boosting Algorithm

1. Initialize model with a constant value:
   ```
   f0(x) = arg min_γ ∑(i=1 to N) L(yi, γ)
   ```

2. For m = 1 to M:
   - For i = 1 to N:
     - Compute the negative gradient (pseudoresidual):
       ```
       rim = -∂L(yi, fm-1(xi))/∂fm-1(xi)
       ```
   
   - Fit a regression tree to the pseudoresiduals, giving regions Rjm for j = 1, 2, ..., Jm
   
   - For j = 1 to Jm:
     - Compute the optimal value for each leaf region:
       ```
       γjm = arg min_γ ∑(xi∈Rjm) L(yi, fm-1(xi) + γ)
       ```
   
   - Update the model:
     ```
     fm(x) = fm-1(x) + ∑(j=1 to Jm) γjm I(x ∈ Rjm)
     ```

3. Return the final model: `fM(x)`

## Classification with Gradient Boosting

For binary classification:

1. Convert class labels to {-1, 1}
2. Use an appropriate loss function (e.g., binomial deviance)
3. The final prediction is made by taking the sign of the model output:
   ```
   G(x) = sign(fM(x))
   ```

## Implementation Considerations

### Tree Size
- Smaller trees (limited depth) often work better
- A common approach is to restrict all trees to the same size
- Tree size controls the interaction order in the model

### Regularization
- Learning rate (shrinkage): multiply each tree's contribution by a small constant
- Subsampling: use only a random subset of the training data for each tree
- Early stopping: monitor performance on validation set and stop when it no longer improves

### Hyperparameters
- Number of trees (M)
- Tree depth or number of leaf nodes
- Learning rate
- Minimum samples per leaf
- Subsampling rate

## Advantages
- Handles mixed data types
- Robust to outliers
- Can capture non-linear relationships
- Often provides high accuracy

## Limitations
- Sequential nature makes it harder to parallelize
- Can overfit if not properly regularized
- Requires careful tuning of hyperparameters
